# ak:hyperframes

Wrap HeyGen's [`hyperframes`](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes) CLI
for HTML-first programmatic video generation. This skill is docs+wrap only —
no vendored HeyGen source, no copied HeyGen agent skills. Every command below
runs the published npm package through `npx`, pinned to a known-good version.

## When to use

- Short vertical/social videos (1080×1920, 9:16) rendered from HTML/CSS.
- Product-launch clips, promo loops, motion graphics authored as HTML
  composition rather than React components or timeline editors.
- Any task where the composition source of truth is HTML markup with
  `data-composition-id` / `data-start` timing attributes (see
  [references/composition-basics.md](references/composition-basics.md)).

Not a fit for React-first compositions, frame-accurate interpolation curves,
or Remotion's audio/caption ecosystem — see also the installed remotion skill
for that alternative (React-based programmatic video). Not a fit for pure
FFmpeg/ImageMagick encode-only tasks — see also the ak-media-processing skill.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- FFmpeg on `PATH`
- Optional: a HeyGen cloud/lambda API key (`HEYGEN_API_KEY`) for remote
  rendering; local rendering works without it.

Run the bundled verifier before starting any render work:

```bash
node scripts/verify-prereqs.mjs
# or, for machine-readable output:
node scripts/verify-prereqs.mjs --json
```

See [references/env-and-deps.md](references/env-and-deps.md) for install
instructions per platform and the pinned-version verification note.

## Pinned CLI version

Every invocation below pins `hyperframes@0.7.99` — the latest published
version as of 2026-08-07 (`npm view hyperframes version`). Bump this pin in
one place (this file + `references/render-workflow.md`) when upgrading; do
not run an unpinned `npx -y hyperframes ...` in scripts or docs.

## Workflow

The standard loop is `init → edit HTML → preview → lint → render`. Full
concrete invocations for each stage live in
[references/render-workflow.md](references/render-workflow.md); the short
form:

```bash
# 1. Scaffold a new composition project.
npx -y hyperframes@0.7.99 init my-composition --resolution portrait

# 2. Edit the generated HTML composition (see composition-basics.md for the
#    data-composition-id / data-start / data-width / data-height contract).

# 3. Preview in a local dev server.
npx -y hyperframes@0.7.99 preview my-composition

# 4. Lint the composition before rendering (catches malformed timing attrs).
npx -y hyperframes@0.7.99 lint my-composition

# 5. Render to MP4.
npx -y hyperframes@0.7.99 render my-composition --output ./assets/videos/my-composition.mp4
```

Always run `lint` before `render` — a composition that lints clean fails the
render step far less often than one that skips straight to rendering.

## Composition contract

HyperFrames compositions are plain HTML files annotated with
`data-composition-id`, `data-start`, `data-width`, and `data-height`
attributes on the root element(s). See
[references/composition-basics.md](references/composition-basics.md) for the
full attribute reference and a complete vertical 1080×1920 example.

## Reference material

- [references/heygen-skills.md](references/heygen-skills.md) — the 25 HeyGen
  agent skills this wrapper defers to instead of re-implementing; install
  them via `npx -y hyperframes@0.7.99 skills` when deeper HyperFrames-specific
  expertise (animation, keyframes, captions, product-launch templates, etc.)
  is needed.
- [references/composition-basics.md](references/composition-basics.md) — HTML
  composition attribute contract with a full vertical-preset example.
- [references/render-workflow.md](references/render-workflow.md) — the full
  `init → edit → preview → lint → render` flow with every pinned invocation.
- [references/env-and-deps.md](references/env-and-deps.md) — Node/FFmpeg/API
  key setup per platform.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `command not found: ffmpeg` | Run `node scripts/verify-prereqs.mjs` for the exact remediation for your platform. |
| `npx hyperframes` reports an unknown flag | The pinned version in this file may be behind upstream; run `npx -y hyperframes@0.7.99 --help` to confirm current flags before updating the pin. |
| `render` fails with a blank/short MP4 | Run `lint` first; most render failures are malformed `data-start`/`data-composition-id` attributes caught by lint. |
| Remote/cloud render needed | Set `HEYGEN_API_KEY` per [references/env-and-deps.md](references/env-and-deps.md), then use `hyperframes cloud render` (a separate top-level command, not a `render` flag) — see [references/render-workflow.md](references/render-workflow.md). |
