# Suite Audit Workflow (`audit`)

Find and repair tests that lie. LLM-authored code often optimizes for "done"
at any cost, so suites accumulate tests written only to pass, disabled tests,
unfinished tests, and stubs that assert nothing. The audit restores the suite's evidential value.

## 1. Parallel scout pass

Dispatch multiple parallel `ak:scout` subagents with disjoint scopes over the
test suite and CI/CD workflows:

- test files per area (unit/integration/e2e/UI);
- CI workflow files, including selection/skip logic and ignored lanes;
- git history of test files (when tests were weakened, skipped, or deleted —
  `git log -p` over test paths).

## 2. Detection targets

Hunt for each class with concrete evidence (file:line):

- **Deceptive tests** — tests written only to pass: tautological asserts
  (`expect(true)`), asserting the mock instead of the behavior, snapshotting
  whatever the code currently does, catching and swallowing the failure,
  over-broad mocks that bypass the code under test.
- **Disabled tests** — commented-out or skipped tests (`skip`, `todo`, `xit`,
  `t.Skip`, `@pytest.mark.skip`) without a linked reason or issue.
- **Unfinished tests** — empty bodies, `TODO: implement`, setup without
  assertions, placeholders left "for later".
- **Ineffective tests** — pass with the bug present (spot-check by mutating
  the code under test and watching for a failure), assert implementation
  details instead of contracts, or duplicate another test's coverage.
- **Missing edge cases** — boundaries, empty/null inputs, concurrency,
  error paths, permission failures on covered features.
- **Redundant tests** — overlapping low-value tests whose removal loses no
  coverage (prove with a coverage diff before deleting).
- **Outdated tests** — tests locked to removed features, renamed APIs, or
  contracts the current code no longer has.
- **Security gaps in tests** — hardcoded real credentials or tokens in
  fixtures, tests that print secrets, missing security coverage for authz/authn
  failure paths, injection-shaped inputs never exercised.
- **CI blind spots** — lanes that never run, always-green jobs with masked
  exit codes (`|| true`), result files ignored by the gate.

## 3. Rank and decide

Classify each finding: **Critical** (deceptive/disabled test hides a real
regression path, secret exposure) → **Important** (ineffective, outdated,
missing edge case) → **Minor** (redundancy, style). For each, record evidence,
the proposed repair (rewrite / re-enable with fix / add cases / delete), and
the risk of the repair itself.

## 4. Repair and apply

- With `--interview`: present the ranked change list and interview the user per
  group before applying; apply only approved repairs. Otherwise apply directly
  and report everything.
- Rewrite deceptive/ineffective tests to assert the observable contract; each
  repaired test must fail when its target bug is reintroduced.
- Re-enable disabled tests by fixing the underlying cause — never delete a
  skip marker without making the test genuinely pass.
- Add the missing edge cases; delete redundant tests only with a coverage diff
  proving nothing is lost.
- Remove real secrets from fixtures; replace with synthetic values.
- Run the full suite after repairs; everything green, no new skips.

## 5. Report

Per `references/report-format.md`: findings by class and severity with
evidence, repairs applied vs deferred (and why), coverage before/after,
suite-trustworthiness assessment, unresolved questions last.
